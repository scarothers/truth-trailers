get into the Nationals first and Michelson with you in an atom what is the teams biggest
0:05	
early season concern in your mind there's lots to choose from
0:10	
give me what you think is the biggest the biggest reason to worry probably because I like
0:15	
satellite the guy at and also because he is it from the original team here
0:20	
Zimmerman Astro ing problem and shoulder
0:25	
things that that's been lingering from last season an erection goes back a couple seasons now
0:30	
we're talking surgery talking rehab everything that he could possibly do on
0:35	
on for the shoulder has been done and you wonder if it's just going to be a chronic
0:40	
carryover for for much longer than it should
0:45	
should really make the contract early signs of not a bargain
0:50	
any shape or form if the extension is only one weekend a hundred million extension
0:55	
dan what do you think the first base which is probably
1:00	
can't play 3rd base this season ever release you because Adam LaRoche
1:05	
can have to remain headers
1:10	
how many legitimate Toys R Us
1:15	
there are only store
1:20

big tits in a game to a guy with a man in a field starter
2:00	
alright I would
2:05	
conservative back off of white wives with speaking of
2:10	
health affect their there have been some some quick injuries
2:15	
taking place that you you look after the lineup in Atlanta to Houston
2:20	
you start to think are they going to be able to stay healthy with with everything that they have
2:25	
going on so Wilson Ramos right off the bat
2:30	
is this it so to me I think that when you
2:35	
when you look roster wise what does team is capable of doing when everybody's healthy
2:40	
think they can they can do well but it just seems library quickly
2:45	
Kylie and very early you're saying health concerns in the end if you can stay healthy
2:50	
say healthy eyes going to be hard for you to have the the bullseye once again on your on
2:55	
to be able to win every where
3:00	
everywhere and you don't have the guys out there to to help you get those Winslet
3:05

3:15	
how to start sit still striking people out 16 strikeouts
3:20	
6ers of those to which one of the war which one
3:25	
20 worries you the most or would give you a concern you can you can write bubble butt
3:30	
hid say for the sake of saying that one of them
3:35	
concerns up early and I think that there two gifted into Garmin
3:40	
Downton guys after dark
3:45	
there's cause for concern and then someone like like Bryce
3:50	
is Harper is going to use to gift an app to not find his
3:55	
find his way so it's too early to sit there and feel like I'm concerned that one of the main I have
4:00	
season 2 release to Micro B cuz
4:05	
cuz it aint even our great story on him finding balance
4:10	
child in all the things that go along with his life now
4:15	
I still think internalize Aladdin eatery pictures every 5 days
4:20	
packing at the ball at Bryce Harper and trying to find a place is a guy who
4:25	
guys who really but here
4:30	
nn so here's a guy in my mind it that it
4:35	
if he has a bad start internalize it for 45 days
4:40	
error of Michael Kors
4:45	
the first are there is a 13 on earth roamer think I can
