In Africa today, a plane carrying the presidents of two African nations has apparently been shot down as it was coming in for a landing in the capital of Rwanda. UN officials say they both presidents were killed there. The leader of Rwanda--

April 7, 1994. The tiny central African country of Rwanda appeared today to have descended into chaos. At this early stage in the first week of April, I, and I don't think anybody, had any idea where this was heading. We knew it was going to be bloody and messy. But we didn't think it was anything systematic. None of us had any idea of the depths that the horror would come to.

The best estimate now, looking back, is about 800,000 people were killed in 100 days of chaos, of violence, there. That's 56,000 people being killed every week. Or, if you break it down even further, that's 8,000 people a day being killed or 333 people being killed every hour for 100 days, for 100 days.

That almost screams out to you that the entire population was involved, as it was. Neighbor's were killing neighbors. Hutu and Tutsi who had lived peacefully next to each other, suddenly became enemies. And the Hutu would go over and just slaughter the Tutsi neighbor.

They were able to kill 800,000 people with very low-tech means. I'm talking machetes. I'm talking with knives. I'm talking with gardening tools. It was just basically a low-tech genocide.

May 7. The massacres that have claimed up to 200,000 lives in Rwanda did not begin as a spontaneous outpouring of tribal rage, but rather as a systematic campaign of killing directed by political leaders and backed by the military.

Now the Clinton administration later said that they had no idea of the scale of the violence or what was going on. I refer them to that story, telling them that at that point, this is pretty early on, already 200,000 people had been killed in a campaign of violence orchestrated by the government and the military and by this radio station that was on the air, the Radio Mille Collines, which was exhorting people to go out and kill their neighbors.

June 10. The commander of the small United Nations detachment in Rwanda conceded today that his efforts to broker a cease-fire in the civil war there have shown no signs of success. He predicted more fighting and more massacres.

This was the Canadian general Romeo Dallaire who was deeply affected by his inability to stop this crisis going on and the inability of the UN to organize, to do anything to help beef up his force or the inability or unwillingness of any other large actor, like the United States, the Brits, the French, to do it, to send in any troops to help out.

We have every reason to believe that acts of genocide have occurred.

How many acts of genocide does it take to make genocide?

There was, I think, just a collective willingness back in the United States, and in all the world capitals, to put your hands in the sand. I mean, this was only six months after we had lost a huge number of army rangers during the Black Hawk Down incident in Somalia. And I think there was no appetite in Washington at that time to engage ourselves in another African tribal war.

July 30. Goma, Zaire. The cholera epidemic that has ravaged the Rwandan refugee population and produced piles of rotting corpses along roads in Zaire has finally shown signs of ebbing, but relief workers here are bracing for the possible onslaught of another disease that could claim, even more lives-- dysentery.
