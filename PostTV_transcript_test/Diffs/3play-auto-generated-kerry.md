And quite simply what we see from Russia is an illegal and illegitimate effort to destabilize a sovereign state and create a contrived crisis with paid operatives across an international boundary engaged in this initiative. Russia's clear and unmistakable involvement in destabilizing and engauging in separatist activities in eastern Ukraine is more than deeply disturbing. Mo one should be fooled and believe me no one is fooled by what could potentially be a contrived pretext for military intervention just as we saw in Crimea. it is clear the Russian special forces and agents have been the catalyst behind the chaos in the last 24 hours. Some have even been arrested and exposed. and equally as clear must be the reality that the United States and our allies will not hesitate to use 21st century tools to hold Russia accountable for 19th century behavior.
