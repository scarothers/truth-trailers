These are the closed-caption results I got back on our sample videos from 3PlayMedia. These are done *only by a computer*. There is no human edit on them. That means they will have errors. 

To get a sense of just how many errors, take a look at these two links: 

https://github.com/scarothers/truth-trailers/commit/ec56ee33481d9a373fce174f6c0aa52450ece83e?short_path=d4bcde9#diff-d4bcde94fe39bf1cf83bbab1870dd35a

https://github.com/scarothers/truth-trailers/commit/68dcdedc8acb82a478c158b3c26325eccb417bf4?short_path=50beae6#diff-50beae600c4a2be49772c848f499fce1

That visualizes what I had to edit to make it 100% accurate. Red is what I deleted; green is what I added.
