00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,260

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:10,930
Doing that domino effect is the
potential for the $1.2 trillion

3
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:15,400
of student loans to impact the
mortgage market small business

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,160
formation future retirement
security and much more

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,860
when people's income is being
soaked up by their student debt

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,190
payments that means
less money they can

7
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,530
and save for retirement
for a down payment

8
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,120
and it may mean that they're
less willing to take a risk

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:37,120
to start a small business
or to try something new

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,410
the top piece the advice I can
give to streamline borrowers

11
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,490
is if you're in
trouble do not lead

12
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,020
the telephone calls or the way.

13
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,130
Let's take action.

14
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:52,270
You go to consumer finance
staff at the end user are paying

15
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:56,030
for college platform, which
with a few clicks of the button

16
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:00,420
to help you navigate
different repayment options

17
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,040
and I'll probably default.

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,250
A lot of people are eligible
for income base repayment

19
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,350
and may not even you
can go to student loans

20
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,620
these dots and estimate
how much your payment might

21
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:18,390
be under this program and you
can even electronically five

22
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,510
you can also call your
student loan servicer

23
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:25,080
and ask them for more
information about it.

24
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:33,867
