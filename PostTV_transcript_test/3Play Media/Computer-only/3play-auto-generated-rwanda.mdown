In Africa data plane carrying the presidents of to African nations has apparently been shot down as it was coming in for a landing in the cap of the real one the UN officials say they both presidents were killed or the leader of a April 7, 1994 the tiny Central African country of Rwanda here today to a descended into chaos at this early stage in a very early in the first week of April we I don't think anybody had any idea where this was heading we knew it was going to be bloody and messy but we didn't think it was anything systematic none of us had any idea of the steps or would come to the best estimate. Now, looking back is about 800,000 people were killed in 100 days of five oh oh chaos of violence there that's 56,000 people being killed every week or if you break it down even further. That's 8,000 people a day being killed to or 333 people being killed every hour for 100 days for 100 days that almost screams out to you that the entire population was involved as it was neighbor's were killing neighbors Hutu and Tutsi would live peacefully next to each other suddenly became enemy is not what you would go over to slaughter the duty neighbor they're able to kill 800,000 people it with very low tech means I'm talking machetes I'm talking with knives I'm talking with gardening tools was just basically a low tech genocide May 7 the massacres that have claimed up to 200,000 lives in Rwanda did not begin as a spontaneous outpouring of tribal rage but rather as a systematic campaign of killing directed by political leaders and backed by the military core the Clinton administration later said that they had no idea of the scale of the violence or what was going on. I refer them to that story telling them that at that point, that's a pretty early on already 200,000 people had been killed in a campaign of violence orchestrated by the government military and by this radio station that was on the areas of radio milk will be sorting go up to their neighbors. I had month ago I do give you a while June 10 the commander of the small the United Nations detachment in Rwanda conceded today that his efforts to broker a ceasefire in the Civil War, there have shown no signs of success you predicted more fighting and more massacres this was the Canadian general Romeo the Layer 2 it was deeply affected by his inability to stop this crisis going on. And the inability of the UN to organize to do anything to help beef up his force or the inability or unwillingness of any other large actor like the United States the Brits the French to do it to send the nature to help out. We have every reason to believe it acts of genocide have occurred to me to do great to get there was I think in just a collective willing this back in the United States and all the world capitals to put your hands in the sand and this was only six months after we had lost a huge number of army rangers in during the Black Hawk down incident Somalia and I think there was no appetite in Washington at that time to engage ourselves in another African tribal war July 30 film was later, the cholera epidemic that has ravaged one in refugee population and produce piles of rotting corpses along roads and so there has finally shown signs of ebbing but relief workers here are bracing for the possible onslaught of another disease they could claim even more lines or disappearing low this was the end of July by this time, the war was winding down. And a lot of attention to turn to what to do about this massive refugee population of Hutus among many, many of them were the killers political leaders who orchestrated this campaign of violence. I must say that a lot of people we're looking at this, just horrific scene of the death and misery going on in these refugee camp to think it was almost some type of retribution for what I've gone on inside of a one time we keep telling ourselves that never again, are we going a lot of this kind of a Holocaust happened we said that after World War Ii we said that after the Camaro Rouge genocide in Cambodia we said it after belatedly after Rwanda. But then we see it again. And there are four in right now we're looking at what's happening in Syria there's something like the Civil War, a man made incident like this. I think there's really a reluctance to get involved and maybe even a willingness to put our heads back in the sand the same way we did with the one that it's going to be something that we end up regretting.
