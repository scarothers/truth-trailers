1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,580
If you make a deal
with the devil

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:06,610
on releasing those
five tell them

4
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,720
I think this was a
very hard choice, which

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:20,430
is why I think my
book is so aptly named

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,110
if you look at what the factors.

7
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:26,540
We're going into the
decision of course,

8
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,155
there are competing
interests and values.

9
00:00:29,155 --> 00:00:41,170

10
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,060
One of our values is
we bring everybody home

11
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,230
off the battlefield.

12
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,420
The best we can
it doesn't matter

13
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,580
how they ended up in a
prisoner of war situation

14
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,590
it doesn't matter
does not matter.

15
00:00:53,590 --> 00:01:03,410
We bring our people home
how was your health.

16
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:04,430
It's very good.

17
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:14,330
Thank you how
serious it was really

18
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,070
wasn't that I think
a serious concussion.

19
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:22,470
I ran into congressman Paul Ryan
at the inauguration last year.

20
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,070
And I had ready was
this great athlete

21
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,500
and I said they did you have
a concussion goes oh yes he

22
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,540
said I had several I think
three in the last one mysterious

23
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:39,430
but my mother was smart enough
to make me stay in it what

24
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,700
happens to athletes soldiers
young people in car accidents

25
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,830
all the reasons why people
get concussions if they come

26
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:50,890
to shake it off and I felt like
you get back UPI can go to work

27
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:53,950
and the doctor said, no,
you're going to stay and rest

28
00:01:53,950 --> 00:02:06,460
because then you will have a
complete recovery because you'd

29
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,970
have a club and you're right.

30
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:13,380
I can't retract my related yes
so blood thinners but senators

31
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,510
for life probably but I don't
mind, because I don't ever

32
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,100
want to have to go
through that again.

33
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,370
So no lingering effect
no lingering effect

34
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:32,890
of it what would you like to say
to Carl wrote about your brain

35
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:36,550
that I know he was
called Bush's brain

36
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,120
in one of the books
written about him.

37
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:51,910
And I wish him well
change is great to be

38
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:59,680
our age Mitch McConnell
said at one point,

39
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,280
the 2016 will be the
return Golden Girls

40
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,920
that was a very popular
long running TV series.

41
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:20,572
