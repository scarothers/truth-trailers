And the kind of jumped into the set-top box forget the new fire TV here's how it stacks up against the competition you everyone is investing in building up their catalog but it's going to take them a while to supplement the year. That's already on Amazon and video and they're an original content his main focus is building out their catalog as much as they possibly can. That's all they do. And so there's a lot of time and effort into building out the greatest variety of shows they possibly can services for the iTunes store, which of course, has a great variety of stuff. But it's not a lot of variety of pricing if Apple doesn't have to figure out it all Amazon's killer feature for search is that you talk to the right rather than having to hunt in packs to type in your search term but Washington the dosage doesn't work on all laughed and so that's something that you should definitely keep in mind search as well. But it's also unified. So if looking for a title, and you see that it's on a couple of services you can click on that, and it'll show you price comparisons and give you a little more information you need one before hitting the purchase Apple such as pretty standard but it's very easy to read and easy to find the content that you want Amazon talked about gaming as a bonus feature, but it's clear that they're investing a lot of money and time they have their own game studio and responded to the launch games that they have this box. This is a really casual games. Most notably Angry Birds but that's a motion sensor in the remote control Apple. Well I haven't quite done.       </p>
