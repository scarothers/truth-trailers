1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,499

2
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:07,570
If it there's three
battery tips that I

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:12,650
use for making this past weekend
or as we say in England I

4
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:18,010
did at the first is that
I melt the butter right

5
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,820
rather than cream that's
melting the butter makes it much

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,840
more buttery soft voiced the
second tip is infusing believes

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,530
in the butter believes have this
elusive perturbations flavor

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,930
when you add it to the
butter catastrophic

9
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:35,210
that flavor and makes
take much more flavorful

10
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,306
the third tape this
piping but are still

11
00:00:37,306 --> 00:00:39,430
going to go ahead and make
a little parchment paper

12
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:43,390
phone you want to have the point
it tipped up for this piece

13
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:47,210
over in this piece over,

14
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,710
you want to keep
going all the way

15
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:52,815
around bring them all the
way up until you have.

16
00:00:52,815 --> 00:00:56,880

17
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:04,610
And so you see the three and
you folded over and write up

18
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,200
a little disposable phone.

19
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,750
So I'm going to take about a
tablespoon of softened butter

20
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:12,175
and stick it in the company
should be very soft.

21
00:01:12,175 --> 00:01:13,550
So make sure
because once you get

22
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,180
in the cone there's
no going back I think

23
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,750
it takes the top
arises that informs

24
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,800
this beautiful premise
of golden brown goodness

25
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,990
when people to take out
the other you're like, wow,

26
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:25,820
I made that.

27
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,050
