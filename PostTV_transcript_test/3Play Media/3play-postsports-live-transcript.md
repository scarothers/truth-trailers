Get into the Nationals first. And Michael, I start with you on the Nats. What is the team's biggest early season concern in your mind? There's lots to choose from. Give me what you think is the biggest reason to worry about the Nats.

Well, partly because I like the guy, and also because he's from the original team here, Ryan Zimmerman and his throwing problem and his shoulder. I think that that's been lingering from last season. And it actually goes back a couple seasons now.

But we're talking surgery. We're talking rehab. Everything that he could possibly do for this shoulder has been done. And you wonder if it's just going to be a chronic thing that's going to carry over for much longer than it should and really make the contract that he signed not a bargain in any shape or form.

Yeah, the extension, he's only one week into that $100 million extension. Dan, what do you think?

I think that's a good one. And going further, even if he moves to first base, which is probably his eventual destination, if he can't play third base this season, they have a real issue. Because Adam LaRoche can't play anywhere besides first base. And you can't have two of your main hitters that both will play the same position. That just doesn't make any sense. I think that's a good one.

I think it's amazing how many legitimate choices there are for a team that's 4 and 2. I mean, they're 4 and 2. Everything should be fine. There is, like, so many story lines that could be troubling.

Mine's gonna be the Braves, which I talked about a couple weeks ago here. They just had the Nationals' number so much last year, and going into this first series at home, with the Braves kind of reeling from all these injuries. Just like, kind of winning a series, you would've hoped. And you know, going into that last game, obviously it's early April, but you don't want to get swept at home by the Braves. It almost felt like not a must-win clearly, but it felt like a potential crucial game in the first week of April.

So kind of bizarre, but I think that at some point this season if they want to get back to first place, they're going to have to beat the Braves. It's not losing two out of three every time or getting swept like they did so many times last year. That's not gonna cut it.

Taylor Jordan stepped up big in that Sunday game too. For a guy who's--

With a lineup of--

--maybe a fifth starter.

--a lineup of a bunch of Triple-A guys.

Right, right a bunch of guys had the day off, Zimmerman and Harper.

All right. What do you got, LaVar? What's your biggest area of concern for the team?

I want to piggy back off of what Wise was speaking of. I think it's going to be health. I think there have been some quick injuries that have taken place that you look at the lineup, and it lends to you starting to think, are they going to be able to stay healthy with everything that they have going on?

Wilson Ramos right off the bat was a key injury.

Yeah, first game.

Doug Fister before the season even started.

So to me, I think that when you look roster wise what this team is capable of doing when everybody's healthy, I think they can do well. But it just seems like very quickly and very early you're seeing health concerns. And if you can't stay healthy, it's going to be hard for you to have the bullseye once again on your back and on your chest and on your head to be able to win.

Everywhere.

It's everywhere. And you don't have the guys out there to help you get those wins.

Let me ask you guys this. Of the two that weren't mentioned, Harper's slow start batting .143, 10 strikeouts, seems lost at the plate and he's said so. And Stephen Strasburg, 0 and 1. He's had two starts. He's still striking people out, 16 strikeouts, but he's got a plus 6 ERA. Of those two, which one worries you the most or would give you pause for concern? You can write both off to being early. But--

I can't say for the sake of saying it that one of them concerns me. I believe it's early.

Still too early for both of them.

And I think that they're are too gifted and too-- I mean that first showing by Strasburg when he mowed down 10 guys.

Yeah, he looked good against the Mets.

Right, I can't sit there and say there's cause for concern. And then someone like Bryce Harper, he's too gifted an athlete to not find his way. So it's too early to sit there and feel like I'm concerned that one of them may not have the type of season they should have.

Too early too, Mike? Or would you take one or the other?

Only Strasburg because, even though Adam Kilgore did a great story on him finding balance with a child and all the things that go along with his life now, I still think he internalizes a lot. And he pitches every five days. So this isn't in a guy who's out there hacking at the ball like Bryce Harper and trying to find his rhythm at the plate. He's a guy who really-- what?

I'm sorry, I was laughing at something else.

And so here's a guy in my mind that if he has a bad start, he internalizes it for four or five days.

And he didn't respond well to the Zimmerman error the other day.

No.

That's why I'm actually going to disagree with Mike. Because I thought Strasburg-- the first start there was the one three-run homer. I think that kind of obviously slanted his ERA. And the second start, he had that inning that he kind of went of the rails a little bit, because of that Zimmerman throwing error. But I think Harper, the thing that bugs me about him so far, and to the extent that it matters at all, it's a week into the season and he's throwing his bat and throwing his helmet. He threw his helmet twice against the-- like dude, just chill out a little bit. I mean--

He's a little hot headed there.

I know how great he wants to be, but I think it's too early in the season to be chucking things around.

And you mentioned it, they're 4 and 2. That's still worth repeating. They're not in first place. It's way too early in a long season to get too worked up about it. But they still have a winning record. They just opened up a series against the surprisingly first-place Marlins, and that's part tonight.
