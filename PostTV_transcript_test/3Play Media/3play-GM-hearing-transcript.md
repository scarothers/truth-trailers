More than a decade ago, GM embarked on a small car program. Sitting here today I cannot tell you why it took so long for a safety defect to be announced for this program, but I can tell you we will find out. This is an extraordinary situation. It involves vehicles we no longer make, but it came to light on my watch, so I'm responsible for resolving it.

Again, you're relating specific incidents that happened--

You don't know?

--and our entire investigation.

You don't know about that? Take a look at tab eight, please. Yeah, and by the way, ma'am, I'm getting this information from the chronology that GM provided to NHTSA.

Right. And they're--

So let me ask you, again, as far back as 2004 GM conducted a problem-resolution tracking system inquiry after it learned of an incident where the key moved out of the run condition. Is that correct?

Yes.

Thank you. Now, after that he PRTS inquiry one engineer advised against further action, because there was, quote, "no acceptable business case to provide a resolution and the PRTS was closed," Is that correct?

If that is true, that is a very disturbing fact.

Yes, it is.

That is not the way we make decisions.

Oh.

We will not accept parts that don't meet our performance, safety, functionality, durability requirements. As I mentioned before in the steel example, there will be times where there will be a material or a part that doesn't meet these exact specification, but after analysis and looking at the performance, the safety, the durability, the reliability, the functionality it will be OK. That happens very often as we buy steal to make the bodies of the vehicles.

Well, then you don't need specifications, with all respect.

No, but--

What I just answered is gobbledygook.

But--

It's your own specification. It's your company specification. If a part doesn't make the specification, why in the world would you not refuse it and only accept a part that meets a specification?

This begins with my sincere apologies to everyone who's been affected by this recall, especially to the families and friends of those who lost lives or were injured. I am deeply sorry and the men and women of General Motors are deeply sorry.

Will you commit to coming back in front of this committee when you can answer the questions?

Yes.

And secondly, all the information you're providing to NHTSA on Friday, would you be so kind as to provide a copy of all that information to this committee?

Yes.

Thank you.

Your lobbying organization is opposing a bill that would make sure that no one, no one would die the way they die. So I would say, Madame Chairman, I am so grateful to you and Senator Heller for this hearing. These issues run deep. And we have work to do. And I am very disappointed, really, as a woman to woman, I am very disappointed, because the culture that you are representing here today is a culture of the status quo.
