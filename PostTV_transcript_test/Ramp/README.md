These are all the results from the Ramp automatic transcript model. 

At first, Ramp only provided us with a 'news' language model. The first seven files are from that. When they visited, they told us they also had a financial, sports, and technology language model. So I ran some of our videos again through that. 

The important part is: These different language models are included in the cost. 

Here is a diff showing the GM video transcribed under the financial language model, and corrected by hand by me:

Obviously the fewer edits, the better the quality.
