truth-trailers
==============

Testing out github's prose editing feature with Truth Teller trailer scripts.

We needed a better way to track changes for a project where we're editing a video script. 

.html files don't work. You have to use a .md file to see the 'Rendered' option (instead of just source diffs). 

Here's the final project: http://www.washingtonpost.com/posttv/entertainment/oscars2014/truthtrailers/truth-teller-american-hustle-trailer/2014/02/23/9479e4d6-9cf0-11e3-8112-52fdf646027b_video.html

Way better track changes visibility than doing it manually in Google Docs. Still figuring out how I can pair this with the actual video file.
