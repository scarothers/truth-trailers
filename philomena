0:10	Martin Sixsmith really was a correspondent for the BBC, based in Russia, the U.S., Belgium and Poland.
He left the network in 1997 work for newly elected Tony Blair.

0:13	Sixsmith resigned from the Blair administration after someone leaked a comment he made.

In an email about 9/11, he’d said: “Today is a good day to bury bad news.”

0:20	 In the film, Philomena’s daughter tips Sixsmith off about Philomena’s story. 

In reality, it was another guest at the party. 

0:36	Philomena hadn’t discussed her secret with anyone in 50 years. 

0:47 	Philomena’s daughter was a financial advisor, not a waitress.

0:53	Sixsmith indeed used Philomena’s real name in his book about her. 
It is titled “The Lost Child of Philomena Lee.”

1:02	Philomena gave birth to her son, Anthony, in an Irish convent as an unwed teenager in 1952. 

She lived and worked in the convent while the nuns cared for her son,
 and the children of other unwed young women. 

1:07	Ireland had many convents like this one, referred to as Magdalene Laundries. 
The mothers worked long hours doing menial labor with little access to their children.
The last one in Ireland closed in 1996.

1:15	The Catholic Church advertised these children as “orphans.” 
Many were adopted by American families in the 1950s and ‘60s. 
The Church charged money for the children, causing scandal for it and the Irish government. 

1:23 	When Philomena’s son Anthony was three years old, 
he was adopted by an American couple, Doc and Marge Hess. 

They renamed him Michael. He grew up in St. Louis. 

1:29	Philomena and Sixsmith never made a trip to the U.S. together to find her son. 
The majority of their research was done in Ireland. 

1:33	The real Philomena Lee told The Washington Post, “I was a bit of a dumb cluck in the film.” 
“Some of those things I didn’t say. “
“But it had to bring a bit of laughter into it. “
“Because it’s so sad, you know.” 

1:45	Michael Hess grew up to attend George Washington University Law School. 
He later became chief legal counsel to the Republican National Committee 
And was a key member of the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations.

1:52	 Michael died of AIDS in 1995.
 He was gay, but kept it largely a secret in his professional life.

1:57	Sixsmith was BBC correspondent in Washington during the presidency of George H.W. Bush. 
In his book he recalls meeting a “senior White House official named Michael Hess.”  
He then used his Washington contacts to make the connection. 

2:09	Michael actually returned to Ireland twice during his life to locate his mother.
 The nuns told him she had abandoned him. 
In reality, the church forced Philomena to sign away her rights to her son.
