0:08	Melvin Weinberg, convicted con artist. 

            He sold fake loans.

0:18	The FBI hired him [hired? or forced to deal or face prison?] to help catch politicians taking bribes. 

            The operation was known as Abscam. 

0:23	Richie DiMaso is based on two FBI agents. 

0:28 	Politicians were caught accepting cash bribes for: 
casino licenses, 
streamlined immigration, 
granting political asylum, and 
investment schemes. 

0:35	Weinberg’s mistress, Evelyn Knight, was part of many of his scams -- but not Abscam. 

Oh, and she was actually English. 


0:48	Carmine Pulito is a stand in for Camden mayor Angelo Errichetti. 

He offered bribes and took kickbacks from congressmen who offered favors.

[Was he a well-meaning guy caught in a well-meaning hustle as portrayed in the movie, or was he just a crook?]

0:56	Cynthia Marie Weinberg was much older than depicted in the film. 

After she learned about his mistress, she accused her husband of taking payoffs and profiting from ABSCAM. [confusing. not sure what we’re saying.]

(She eventually committed suicide.)

1:15	The fake sheik was played by three FBI agents, 
including an American who spoke no Arabic.

1:30	Weinberg invented dozens of scams for the FBI besides Abscam. 

1:39	For the first time in American history, 
the FBI videotaped government officials accepting bribes. 

1:49	The money exchanges took place at the home of a Washington Post reporter who unknowingly had rented it to the FBI.

1:53	Errichetti was convicted of federal bribery charges.
He served about 3 years in prison.

1:59	Not to mention…  
six members of the House of Representatives, 
one senator 
and more than a dozen others were convicted. 

2:11 	Many scenes were invented for dramatic effect. This is one of them. 

Weinberg earned $150,000 for his work on ABSCAM.
